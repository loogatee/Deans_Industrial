BIGGIE LinuxHost: removing PacketCentral, going to pub/sub in serial_recv.c
-------------------------------------------------
    1/1/2020  9pm

    Bangin out the new years in style.
    Thought about shit.
    My design, as embodied in PacketCentral was crap.
    Pub/Sub with serial_recv seems to be the ticket,
         but for packets that originate on host & require a response
    

      - Dloop.c is new.  Derived from PacketCentral.   Does the sub.
        Good example for how to achieve pub/sub with SUBSCRIBE filter

      - Makefile: PacketCentral is no longer needed with the new model

      - Both PacketCentral.c and dloop.lua are effectively deprecated.

      ***Need a dloop.lua equivalent to dloop.c

      - main.c: removed startup for packetcentral

     ***achieved pub sub by switching cmd byte and length byte.
        Then can filter on the 1st byte.
        Means I can have 256 different type of packets.
        Should be plenty.
