 Command 0x0001:   Dloop
------------------------------

    Summary:
              'dloop' is short for 'Data Loop'.  PacketCentral knows
               how to do a dloop, this is merely the trigger for it.
               A dloop is:
                  - sending random data to the device
                  - the device receives the data, and sends back an exact copy 
                  - comparison is made between original data and received data


    Request:

      Byte 0:     Cmd[0] = 0x01
      Byte 1:     Cmd[1] = 0x00
      Byte 2:     size of a dloop packet.  Allowed values are 0x01..0xFE
      Byte 3:     number of dloops  0x01..0xFF


    Response:

       A string which shows the success or failure of the dloop.
       There are 3 outcomes of the dloop:
            1.  Success
            2.  Timeout        (Sent some data, got nothing back)
            3.  data mismatch

       The possible responses are formatted in the following way:

       if( result == DLOOP_GOOD)
          sprintf((char *)dbuf,"GOOD,%d,%d",num_loops,data_size);
       else if( result == DLOOP_TIMEOUT)
          sprintf((char *)dbuf,"ERROR,timeout,numloops = %d",num_loops);
       else
          sprintf((char *)dbuf,"ERROR,dloop data mismatch,numloops = %d",num_loops);





 Command 0x0002:   SetLeds
------------------------------

    Summary:
              There's 4 Leds on the Board: LED0, LED1, LED2, LED3
              This command allows the Leds to be turned On or Off

    Request:

      Byte 0:     Cmd[0] = 0x02
      Byte 1:     Cmd[1] = 0x00
      Byte 2:     Led Number.  0 for Led0, 3 for Led3
      Byte 3:     On/Off.      0 = Off, 1 = On


    Response:

         < There is no response >





 Command 0x0003:   Hard Reset the Device
----------------------------------------

    Summary:
              This command causes the board to self-reset, in this case
              the PIC will end up pulling reset.
              Length of data should be 3 bytes, even though the
              last byte is effectivelfy a NOP.

    Request:

      Byte 0:     Cmd[0] = 0x03
      Byte 1:     Cmd[1] = 0x00
      Byte 2:     don't care


    Response:

         < There is no response >
